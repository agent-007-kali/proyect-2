// Image data would normally be handled here, but I will assume the image is already available or I'll use a placeholder if I can't save the actual bitstream. 
// Actually, I can't "save" the image from the user's message directly as a file unless I have the bytes.
// I will use the path `/agentic-spy.jpg` in the code and instruct the user to save their image there.
